# CSVReaderTestProject
Test project to read a csv file and return sorted results

The program reads a CSV file and outputs two text files: 

The first shows the frequency of the first and last names ordered by frequency descending and then alphabetically ascending.  
E.g.  Smith, 4 
      Jones, 3 
      Martin, 3 
      Brown, 1  
 
The second should show the addresses sorted alphabetically by street name. 
E.g.  12 Acton St 
      31 Clifton Rd 
      22 Jones Rd 

The project includes a unit test project.
